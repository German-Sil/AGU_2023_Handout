## Final Model Variable Importance

Fig. S1: Variable importance (scaled 0-1) plot for elevation and spectral variables. 0 = no importance, 1 = most important. Orange line represents increase in node purity, green dashed line represents % increase mean square error. Elevation and mARI are the most important variables for this model's prediction.

## Additional Variable Combinations

### Spectral Indices and Principal Components

Fig. S2: Scatterplot of spectrally predicted soil salinity vs actual values. Dashed line represents 1:1 line. r = 0.66, R^2 = 0.459

Fig. S3: Variable importance (scaled 0-1) plot for spectral variables. 0 = no importance, 1 = most important. Orange line represents increase in node purity, green dashed line represents % increase mean square error. mARI most important variable, followed by principal component 5 for this model's prediction.

### Principal Components included with Elevation and Indices

Pricipal Components were excluded from the final model as they did not improve correlation between predicted and actual values (Fig. S4) and showed low variable importance (Fig. S5).
